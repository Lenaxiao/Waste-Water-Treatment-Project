# Use Cases

### First Use Case

Name: Build a Machine Learning Model
What it does: It takes data as inputs and trains a new model that will be used for prediction
Inputs: Data from the water treatment plants
Outputs: How much energy/cost is needed for a particular plant in a particular place for a certain amount of water
How use other components: Data from the water treatment plant database for Europe

### Second Use Case

Name: Predict new treatment plant
What it does: It takes waste water data from the user, what size streams and what type
Inputs: User gives waste water data, size, and type
Outputs: Energy/cost of new water treatment plant
How use other components: Uses the machine learning model and the user interface

### Third Use Case

Name: Data Visualization
What it does: Visualizes the waste water treatment database
Inputs: Waste water treatment database
Outputs: plots
How use other components: database, user interface
