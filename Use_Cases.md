# Use Cases

### First Use Case

Name: Build a Machine Learning Model<br/>
What it does: It takes data as inputs and trains a new model that will be used for prediction<br/>
Inputs: Data from the water treatment plants<br/>
Outputs: How much energy/cost is needed for a particular plant in a particular place for a certain amount of water<br/>
How use other components: Data from the water treatment plant database for Europe

### Second Use Case

Name: Predict new treatment plant<br/>
What it does: It takes waste water data from the user, what size streams and what type<br/>
Inputs: User gives waste water data, size, and type<br/>
Outputs: Energy/cost of new water treatment plant<br/>
How use other components: Uses the machine learning model and the user interface<br/>

### Third Use Case

Name: Data Visualization<br/>
What it does: Visualizes the waste water treatment database<br/>
Inputs: Waste water treatment database<br/>
Outputs: plots<br/>
How use other components: database, user interface<br/>
